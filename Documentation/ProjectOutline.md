# Basic Project Outline - Restaurant Roulette

Idea:
- Develop a webpage that gathers a user's location and their preferred search radius to pick a local restaurant in their area for the user to eat at

Goal(s):
- Deliver a working webpage that will help the user decide which restaurant to eat at
- Successfully follow through with an Agile-like SDLC approach (longer sprints)
  
Objective(s):
- Host the webpage via Github for difficulty reasons
- Get necessary information from user (location, radius)
- Implement Google API to determine:
  - The user's location on the map
  - Local restaurants (respective to the user and preferred radius)
- Design meaningful GUI elements
- And of course, stay security-minded
