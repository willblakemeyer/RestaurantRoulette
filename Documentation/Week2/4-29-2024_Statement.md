# Standup 4-29-2024 API Vulnerabilities/ User Input 

> The current implementation of the API requires the admin to manually add your IP to use the website.
> This is very secure but requires the user to contact the admin to be able to use the application.
> This hinders the user's experience but keeps the application very secure. A new way to keep the API key
> safe needs to be implemented in order to balance both security + user experience.
>
> Input from the user will be implemented within this sprint. Developers must ensure that input must be correctly formatted + not include potential blacklisted words.
> The API requires two types of inputs. Either coordinates or an exact address is required. Developers must include a way to auto-fill addresses which will help deter
> the use of incorrect user input.
