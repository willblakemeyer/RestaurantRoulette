# Scope Statement
---

We will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a website that will allow a user to randomly select somewhere to eat based on certain criteria. This criteria will be their location, the maximum radial distance away from them, and potentially their price range ($, $$, $$$). In this website, once the user has selected the settings they want, they will be able to click a button which redirects them to the wheel.html page. This will allow the user to spin a wheel that contains the randomly-selected restaurants. Once the wheel stops on a restaurant, that restaurant will be chosen and a display will show the user what restaurant has been selected for them. Somewhere on the wheel page will be a button which allows the user to go back to the main page, where the user can start the process again. This tool will only be used to select restaurants for now, and it will be limited to the index.html and wheel.html pages. The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages, which will avoid most of the headaches that come with deploying a website.
