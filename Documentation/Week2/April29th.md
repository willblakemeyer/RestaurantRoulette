# What we're up to:
- Have some settings that the user can interact with, ie. price preferences and radius via Google API
- Fix some formatting for the location entry
- Implement THE WHEEL, ex. add slices for each restaurant
- Navigation element, ex. button below wheel to go back from wheel page
- Host on GitHub pages
- Come up with a scope statement
- Possibly some diagrams or extra info for client knowledge purposes
